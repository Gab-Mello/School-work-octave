I was responsible for the **backend** of this project, which manages the computational processing for a photovoltaic cell simulator. The system is designed to analyze I-V (current-voltage) and P-V (power-voltage) curves under varying operational conditions. My work included developing the backend and integrating it with **GNU Octave**, ensuring efficient data processing, mathematical computation, and seamless communication with the frontend for user visualization.


## Backend Overview

The backend is implemented using **Python** with the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework. It is responsible for:

- **Receiving Input Parameters:** Current, voltage, irradiance, temperature, and shunt resistance values are sent from the mobile application (frontend) in JSON format.
- **Data Validation:** Ensures the input parameters meet the expected ranges to avoid inconsistencies.
- **Integration with GNU Octave:** Executes mathematical calculations through Octave scripts using Python's `subprocess` library.
- **Returning Results:** The backend collects the static graph outputs generated by Octave and serves them directly to the frontend, enabling seamless visualization for the user.

## GNU Octave Integration

The backend integrates with [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), a powerful tool for numerical computation. Octave is used to:

- **Perform Complex Calculations:** Based on the single-diode photovoltaic cell model, Octave computes key parameters like photocurrent, saturation current, and power under varying environmental conditions.
- **Generate High-Quality Graphs:** Produces detailed I-V and P-V curves for both different irradiances and temperatures. These graphs are stored as PNG files for visualization.

## Key Backend Features

- **FastAPI for High-Performance APIs:** Enables efficient communication between the frontend and Octave scripts.
- **Octave Script Invocation:** Uses Python's `subprocess` to dynamically execute Octave functions based on user inputs.

## AWS EC2

During development, the backend was hosted on an **AWS EC2** instance to facilitate testing and ensure reliable access. This temporary setup allowed seamless interaction between the backend and the frontend while validating the system's functionality.
